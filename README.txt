# Lit Engine

Welcome to Lit Engine, a powerful tool for 3D rendering.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues related to shared libraries while running Lit Engine, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Before running Lit Engine, make sure to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the current directory. This ensures that the dynamic linker can find the necessary shared libraries. Use the following command:

 - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


## Run

To run the executable, please execute `chmod +x lit_engine.out` and ./lit_engine.out`. Don't forget to save frequently. Lit Engine is still a prototype and can be unstable.
