# Quickstart
## Cloning the Repository

Do you want to give Lit Engine a quick run on your machine? You can clone the repository by running the following command on your terminal:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/luis605/Lit-Engine
```

If the submodules weren't downloaded, you can intialize them by running:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building and Installing Dependencies
### Linux

Before building the engine, ensure that you have all the dependencies installed. They can be installed by opening the install directory and running *install.sh*:

```bash
cd install
./install.sh
```

Then, you can build the remaining dependencies by running:
```bash
./build_dependencies.sh
```

### Windows
To compile Lit Engine on Windows, youÂ need some dependencies, such as CMake, Make, MSYS2.

1) Make sure you have git installed on your machine. Otherwise, go to https://gitforwindows.org and install the git terminal.

2) Open the Git CMD and clone Lit Engine: `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/luis605/Lit-Engine`

3) To install the MSYS2 installer, visit https://www.msys2.org/ and follow their installation guide.

4) Lanch MSYS2 MINGW64 and run `pacman -S make cmake nasm diffutils mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-python mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw-w64-x86_64-bullet msys/msys2-runtime-devel`. If any installation option pops out, use the default option.

5) Open the Lit-Engine directory inside the MSYS2 MINGW console and run:
```bash
cd include/ffmpeg
./configure --disable-iconv --disable-zlib --disable-network --disable-programs --disable-encoders --disable-demuxers --disable-filters --disable-protocols --disable-openssl --disable-libxml2 --disable-indevs --disable-outdevs # It may take a while
cd ../..
```

6) Build all the dependencies by opening the project main directory and running:
```bash
make build_dependencies
```

7) And finally generate the Makefile and executable by running:
```bash
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. --fresh
```

#

After successfully cloning the repository and setting up the project, you can build and run Lit Engine using our **Makefile**:
```bash
make build
```

```bash
make run
```

Alternatively, you can build and run the engine in a single step using the **brun** target:
```bash
make brun
```

Please note that if you used `make brun` and the build step wasn't executed, you can force a complete rebuild with the following command:
```bash
make -B brun
```

### Debugging
If you encounter any strange behavior and need to debug the engine, you can start the debugger with the following command:
```bash
make debug
```
If you need to rebuild the engine, you can run the build and debug target in a single command
```bash
make bdb
```
